		<h1><strong><u>Disadvantages of Industry 4.0</u></strong></h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;text-align: center; position: relative; top: 7px;">
                Here are few downsides of the Fourth Industrial Revolution
            </p>
            <div class="disadvantage1">
                <h2>1.High Costs:</h2> 
                <p>
                    Not only is technology a major cost to consider, but the expertise in enabling 
                    the technology to be implemented. Having the know-how in newer fields like IoT, 
                    Augmented Reality, and AI can lead to major budget constraints, not to mention a lack 
                    of understanding among all parties involved.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="disadvantage2">
                <h2>2.High Rate of Failure:</h2> 
                <p>The difficulty in launching Industry 4.0 initiatives is that there is often a lack of 
                    direction when it comes to establishing objectives. They are often cross-functional 
                    projects with many stakeholders, which can mean projects can become mired in conflicting 
                    goals, and may simply sputter out.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="disadvantage3">
                <h2>3.Cybersecurity:</h2>
                <p>
                    People, products, and equipment is, and will increasingly be, connected to the internet. 
                    Although this gives us greater access to data via the cloud, it opens up opportunities for 
                    hackers to access networks.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="disadvantage4">
                <h2>4.Need for Highly Skilled Labor: </h2>
                <p>
                    Manufacturing, and industry as a whole, continues to rely on humans to enable production. 
                    However, with the move to digitally connected systems, there is a greater need for highly 
                    skilled labor, which may unintentionally reduce the need for low-skill labor.
                </p>
            </div> 
            <div class="disadvantage5">
                <h2>5.Industry and Market Disruption: </h2>
                <p>
                    With new technologies available, existing solutions will eventually be phased out. Similar 
                    to the Blockbusters of the world, certain industries will be unable to survive what Industry 
                    4.0 brings to market.
